# User Management App

## Usage

In the root directory of the project run:

```javascript
npm run start
```

## Technologies/Libraries used

- React with webpack configuration
- Semantic UI React
- Emotion for styling components
- Eslint with standard for linting

## Notes:

1. Styles and ui/ux are very basic and could be improved.
2. In 'AddUserForm', geolocation could be used to detect user address pin & then allow user to edit it if they want.
3. Adding the new user does not reflect on the 'UsersList' page.
4. No unit or integration tests were implemented.
